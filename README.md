### React inline edit
* Hackathon idea - React based inline edit feature
* Worked on this as a confidential project
* Will sanitize code and commit later.
* Assume that the fields are all text/date/select fields.
* The idea is to allow inline edit, with a way for the user to know that they are in edit mode.
* After the edits are done, allow user to save the data, or cancel.


### React inline select fields
* Worked on this idea through the weekend
* Is confidential, so cannot post here without sanitization
* Uses select fields in a matrix
* Each field is a React component
* Once the fields are filled, it totals it, and displays the value.
* Also calculates based on the value, a conclusion for the data.

### Config generator
* Worked on an idea for generating configs with user input
* This will save a lot of time when creating new configs
* Need to work on a front-end for this

### Reactifying existing Rails app
* Now able to comfortably retrofit React into rails apps
* ERB essentially now renders a component
* More manipulation with JS, combined with back-end functionality with Rails.
